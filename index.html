<h4>Capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian art form created by slaves in colonial Brazil. It has been described as a martial art, dance, form of self-defense, or any hybrid of these. 
 
Capoeira combined ancient rituals and modern creativity into a rich fabric of motion, percussion, and song. A typical capoeira "game" includes traditional music, precise kicks, evasive defense moves, and breathtaking acrobatics. In the words of one of the renowed masters, capoeira is "a dance that is a fight and a fight that is a dance." As anyone who has seen capoeira can attest to, there is nothing else in the world like it.</h4>
